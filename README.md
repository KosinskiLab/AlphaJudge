# AlphaJudge
AlphaJudge is a pipeline that evaluates AlphaFold-predicted protein complexes by combining AI-derived confidence metrics (ipTM, pDockQ, PAE, etc.) with physics-based interface features (contacts, area, energy, electrostatics, etc), producing a unified CSV report for model validation and benchmarking.
